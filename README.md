# Libary-Managenment-System
 I created a library management system using MySQL, designing efficient databases and optimized queries for book, user, loan, and reservation management. This project honed my skills in database design, SQL, and performance optimization.

# Objective
In this project you will build a database for a public library. This database is aimed to collect and analyze information about the clients' reading interests. The project concentrates only on books and the clients' interests in books. The analyses that will result from this project will be used by the library's management to decide on the future purchasing policy.
